resource-blog
The motivation to build this project was make a blog page where web developers can come and write blog.  

i  build this project as a school assignment which also enhanced my frontend and backend skills.

The biggest problem this website solves is it's going to be platform where webdevelopers can come and blog.

As a webdeveloper the biggest thing which i learn was to connect frontend and backend.


There are lot of exciting features about my  website but the most important is the user can log in and go back and see the date when the blog was written.
